This C++ program simulates a Storage Management System for a fictional online retailer named Congo, designed to efficiently track and organize warehouse inventory. Each item in the system is represented by a StoredItem object, which includes a unique ID, a description, and a storage location. The StorageManager class maintains two data structures: an unordered_map for fast lookups by item ID, and a map to keep items sorted alphabetically by their descriptions. The system supports adding new items, retrieving items by ID, removing items, and listing all items in sorted order. It uses smart pointers to manage memory safely and includes custom exception handling to catch and report errors, such as attempting to add duplicate items or remove items that do not exist. The main() function demonstrates the core functionality by adding sample items, handling edge cases like duplicates and missing items, and printing the inventory in order of description.
